<p>
FissuresUtil provides java classes that are built on the Fissures/DHI system
and provide utility funtionality that is used across many clients and servers
created at USC. It depends on the <a href="../fissuresImpl">fissuresImpl</a>
project.
</p>

<p>You are likely will also want 
<a href="../mavenRepository/fissuresIDL/jars">FissuresIDL.jar</a>.
This contains the compiled
Java code that was generated by the IDL to Java compiler. You could recreate
this from the IDL files, but it is usually quicker to download it.
</p>

       <p>A jar file with all classes can be downloaded
         <a href="/software/mavenRepository/fissuresUtil/jars">here</a>.
The <a href="apidocs/index.html">JavaDocs</a> for the latest release of
fissuresUtil can be browsed here.  You may also be interested in the source as
it stands in CVS, which you can get from
<a href="http://roo.seis.sc.edu/fisheye/viewrep/CVS/seis/fissuresUtil">Fisheye</a>,
 our CVS viewer.
