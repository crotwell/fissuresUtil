/**
 * BulletproofNetworkAccess combines our three delicious ProxyNetworkAccess
 * classes in a hard candy shell.  The order is NSNetworkAccess inside a
 * RetryNetworkAccess inside a CacheNetworkAccess.  This means that all of the
 * results you get from the network access will be cached, if there are some
 * transient network issues we'll retry 3 times, and if the network access
 * reference goes stale we'll reget it from the naming service.  It'd be wise
 * to use a NSNetworkDC as the type of NetworkDCOperations as it allows the
 * NetworkDC to be refreshed from the naming service if the reference goes stale
